I have a **cross_correlation** module that performs complex cross-correlation and energy computation over input I/Q data. This module handles the internal processing logic required for computing correlation with conjugate reference sequences.

Can you implement the top-level module **`detect_sequence`** by integrating the **cross_correlation** module at `detect_sequence.sv`?

The design should be fully parameterizable and support flexible configurations to adapt to different processing requirements. Additional glue logic must be implemented both before and after the instantiation of the **cross_correlation** module to handle input data preparation and output result processing.

Please refer to `docs/spec_detect_sequence.md` for design requirements and specifications.
