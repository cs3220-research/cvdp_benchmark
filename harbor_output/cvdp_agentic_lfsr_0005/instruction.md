The `bit16_lfsr` module is designed to generate pseudo-random 16-bit sequences under Galois configuration, following the primitive polynomial x<sup>16</sup>+x<sup>5</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>+1. However, during testing, it was observed that the module fails to generate valid pseudo-random sequences and exhibits incorrect behavior for certain bits, resulting in incomplete sequences and compromising the expected functionality of the module.

Below is a table showing the expected values and the actual values for the lfsr_8bit module:

| Clock Cycle                | Input Seed | Expected Value | Actual Value |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Clock cycle = 1, reset = 0 | FFFF       | FFFF           | FFFF         |
| Clock cycle = 2, reset = 1 | FFFF       | 5555           | D555         |
| Clock cycle = 3, reset = 1 | FFFF       | 2AAA           | EAAA         |
| Clock cycle = 4, reset = 1 | FFFF       | 1555           | F555         |
| Clock cycle = 5, reset = 1 | FFFF       | 0AAA           | FAAA         |
