Design a `binary_to_gray` module in SystemVerilog. Refer to the specification in `docs/specs.md`, which details a parameterized `WIDTH` for an N-bit binary-to-Gray code converter. The module should take an N-bit binary input and generate an N-bit Gray code output using a purely combinational approach. The design must follow the standard Gray code conversion rule where:

  - The most significant bit (`MSB`) remains unchanged.
  - Each subsequent bit is computed as the `XOR` of the current and previous binary bits.

**Requirements:**
  - Implement the next-state computation using a bitwise `XOR` operation.
  - Ensure a fully combinational design with no `clock` or `reset`.
  - The module should be parameterized to support different bit widths.
