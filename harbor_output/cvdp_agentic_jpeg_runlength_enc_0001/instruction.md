Integrate a JPEG run-length encoder consisting of a **run-length stage module (`jpeg_runlength_stage1`)** and a **zero-run suppression module (`jpeg_runlength_rzs`)**, and implement a top-level pipelined encoder at **`rtl/jpeg_runlength_enc.sv`**. The design must follow the JPEG compression protocol and stream over 8×8 DCT coefficient blocks. All module behavior must strictly conform to the design rules and compression behavior defined in **`docs/specification.md`**.

Use the following steps for module integration:

- Implement the **run-length stage** in `rtl/jpeg_runlength_stage1.sv` and **zero-run suppression stage** in `rtl/jpeg_runlength_rzs.sv`.
  - Run-length encoding stage module must detect and distinguish between DC and AC terms, maintain a sample counter for 8×8 block traversal, track zero run-lengths, compute coefficient category (bit size), format the amplitude accordingly, and assert valid output and DC indicators for downstream processing.
  - Zero-run suppression stage module must suppress repeated zero-blocks (run-length = 15, size = 0) using a compact FSM, emit an End-of-Block (EOB) marker when applicable, and ensure proper sequencing of run-length, size, amplitude, and control signals through the pipeline.

- Integrate the full encoding pipeline in the top-level module at `rtl/jpeg_runlength_enc.sv`, connecting the stage-1 run-length encoder(`jpeg_runlength_stage1`) to **four cascaded zero-run suppression stages(`jpeg_runlength_rzs`)**. The top-level module must manage pipeline control (clock/reset/enable), accept incoming 12-bit DCT data, and emit the final encoded run-length, size, amplitude, and control flags with full JPEG compliance.
