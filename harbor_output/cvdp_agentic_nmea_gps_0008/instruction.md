I have an` nmea_decoder` module available in the `rtl` directory and its specification in the `docs` directory. The existing `nmea_decoder` module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that parses NMEA sentences and extracts the first 2-character field after the sentence type $GPRMC.

Modify the code to:

- Add binary conversion logic by extracting numeric characters and converting the 2-character ASCII field to an 8-bit binary output (`data_out_bin`), with a `data_bin_valid` flag.

- Add watchdog timeout detection, enabled via the `watchdog_timeout_en` signal, which asserts `watchdog_timeout` if no carriage return  is received within a configurable cycle window.

- Add buffer overflow detection during sentence parsing. If the internal buffer exceeds its capacity, assert `error_overflow` and reset the parser.

The enhancements introduce robustness and reliability to the parser while retaining its original FSM-driven design. All outputs are updated synchronously and registered.
