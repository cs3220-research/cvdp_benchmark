The module `des_enc` performs the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** encryption. Use it as a reference to create a new module that performs the inverse operation, the **DES** decryption. The module should be defined as `des_dec` and placed in the `rtl` directory as `des_dec.sv`.

The new module must perform bit-accurate DES decryption on a 64-bit plaintext block using a 64-bit key. The module must support synchronous decryption with a valid interface. It must support burst operation, where `i_valid` is asserted for multiple cycles in a row. A testbench, `tb_des_dec.sv`, file is provided to test this new module. No changes to the substitution boxes `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`, `S5`, `S6`, `S7`, and `S8` are required.

- The module's interface must not be changed.
- The module's latency must not be changed. 
- The files in `docs` folder describe the encryption process, and the changes required from the encryption algorithm to the decryption algorithm are described below.

## DES Decryption

To decipher it is only necessary to apply the very same algorithm 'f' of the encryption to an enciphered message block, taking care that at each iteration of the computation, the same block of key bits `K_n` is used during decipherment as was used during the encipherment of the block. Since the encryption uses:

$`L_n = R_{n-1}`$
$`R_n = L_{n-1} ⊕ f(R_{n-1},K_n)`$

By setting the `R_{n-1}` and `L_{n-1}` as the value that is being calculated, this equation can be expressed as:

$`R_{n-1} = L_n`$
$`L_{n-1} = R_n ⊕ f(L_n,K_n)`$

Where now the concatenation of `R_{16}` and `L_{16}` is the permuted, following **IP** permutation, input block for the deciphering calculation and the concatenation of `L_0` and `R_0` is the 'last_perm' wire, that is permutated following the **FP** permutation. 

After applying the initial permutation (IP) to the input, the encrypted data is arranged so that its first 32 bits are `R_{16}` and its last 32 bits are `L_{16}`. This concatenated block (`R_{16}`‖`L_{16}`) serves as the starting, permuted input for decryption. For the decipherment calculation with `R_{16}L_{16}` as the permuted input, `K_{16}` is used in the first iteration, `K_{15}` in the second, and so on, with `K_{1}` used in the 16th iteration. After the decryption rounds, the two halves `L_{0}` and `R_{0}` are concatenated into the wire called `last_perm`({`L_{0}`, `R_{0}`}),  which is then processed by the final permutation (FP) to yield the correct plaintext output. 

The DES encryption algorithm description is available in the `Encryption.md` file and other supporting documentation, and a testbench to verify the expected behavior of the decryption design is available.
