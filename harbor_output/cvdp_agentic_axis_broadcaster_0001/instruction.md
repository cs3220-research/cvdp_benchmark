The `axis_broadcast` module is an AXI Stream broadcast unit that takes a single AXI Stream input and distributes it to three output channels while ensuring synchronized data flow. It ensures that data is only forwarded when all receiver are ready to receive the data. the module should also be able to handle back pressure from the receiver.

During testing it is found that when one or more receiver system is not ready to receive the data, the data broadcasted for the same cycle is lost.

**Bug Description:**
   - In the provided RTL, when one of the master axi stream ready signal  `m_axis_tready_*` is not high, the current data will not be transmitted as data is only forwarded when all receiver are ready to receive the data. but the `s_axis_tready` will be updated in next cycle only 
   - As a result of this the current data from slave will be lost.

Below is a table showing the expected and actual behavior of the `axis_broadcast` module

| `slave_data` | Expected `master_data out` | Actual `master_data out` | `master_ready out` | Expected `slave_ready out` |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| `0xA5`       | `x`                        | `x`                      | 1                  | 1                          |
| `0x5A`       | `0xA5`                     | `0xA5`                   | 0                  | 1                          |
| `0x5B`       | `0xA5`                     | `0xA5`                   | 1                  | 0                          |
| `0x5B`       | **`0x5A`**                 | **`0x5B`**               | 1                  | 1                          |


The module and its testbench are available in the current working directory for further debugging.
