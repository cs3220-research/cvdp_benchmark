### **Bug Fix Request in Arithmetic progression generator RTL**  

I have the Arithmetic progression generator RTL in the current directory, and I need assistance in fixing the following bugs:  

#### **Identified Bugs:**  
1. **Overflow Handling:** Overflow occurs in `out_val` and `counter` when the input values reach their maximum limits.  
2. **Missing Condition for Sequence Length Zero:** The design lacks a check for a sequence length of `0`, leading to incorrect behavior when `0` is applied, as operations continue instead of being skipped.
  
Could you help resolve these bugs in the RTL?
