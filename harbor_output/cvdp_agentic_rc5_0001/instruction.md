Design RTL module `rc5_enc_16bit` in `rtl` directory for a RC5 symmetric block-cipher encryption process based on the following specification and functionality. The design must support encryption of 16-bit plaintext input. The RTL design may assume one round of operation for encryption. The number of S-box variables and their values to be incorporated for encryption can be chosen accordingly. Following interface details have to be used for RTL design of RC5 encryption.

## Interface details

### Inputs:
- **clock (1-bit)**: A single-bit input clock that drives the Finite State Machine executing the encryption algorithm at the positive edge. The clock typically has a 50:50 duty cycle.
- **reset (1-bit)**: A control signal that resets the internal states of the encryption system. The reset can be configured as synchronous active low signal.
- **enc_start (1-bit)**: After this signal becomes HIGH, the encryption process begins
- **p (16-bit,[15:0])** : The 16-bit plaintext input of RC5 encryption 

### Output:
- **c (16-bit,[15:0])** : The 16-bit ciphertext output of RC5 encryption 
- **enc_done (1-bit)**: A HIGH in this output signal indicates the end of RC5 encryption and stable output at `c`, the ciphertext output

## Functionality

### RC5 Encryption algorithm

- The RC5 algorithm is a symmetric block cipher known for its simplicity and effectiveness in converting plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa. 
- It offers flexible options for adjusting block size, key size, and the number of encryption rounds. 
- The RC5 algorithm employs operations such as modulo addition, left rotation, modulo subtraction, right rotation, and XOR in its encryption and decryption processes.

In order to understand the RC5 block cipher encryption, the following parameters are needed:
1. Plaintext (P)
2. Plaintext as w-bit registers (A & B)
2. Data width (2w)
3. S-box key array (S)
4. Rounds of operation (r)
5. Ciphertext (C)

The RC5 encryption algorithm works as follows:

A = A + S[0];\
B = B + S[1];\
for i = 1 to r do\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A = ((A XOR B) <<< B) + S[2&times;i];\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B = ((B XOR A) <<< A) + S[(2&times;i)+1];\
C = {A,B}

Here, <<< : Left rotation; + : Modulo 2<sup>w</sup> addition; A : MSB w-bits of plaintext P;\
B : LSB w-bits of plaintext P; S[0],S[1],S[2],....... : S-box keys ; {} : Concatenation

At the beginning of encryption, the MSB w-bits of plaintext are assumed as A, and the LSB w-bits of plaintext as B. Every step of this algorithm has to be carried out sequentially as the subsequent steps utilize the result of previous computations. Even though the encryption can be carried out on any data width, the recommended plaintext widths are 16,32 or 64. The number of S-box keys for the encryption is 2*(r+1), where 'r' represents the number of rounds. As the number of rounds increases, the algorithm requires more number of S-box keys. In general, S-box keys are assumed by the user during the encryption process which need to be shared for executing the decryption.

## Considerations

- The RTL design specifically should encrypt 16-bit data using four 8-bit S-box constants to meet operational needs. 
- Encryption has to be performed by a Finite State Machine (FSM) that completes one round of the RC5 algorithm in four clock cycles. The FSM progresses through four states: initial addition, computation of the most significant 8-bits (MSB), computation of the least significant 8-bits (LSB), and finally, output of the ciphertext. The system has to operate on 2w bits, where w is 8, fitting the 16-bit encryption scheme.
- The encryption process requires 2(r+1) S-box entries, where r represents the number of rounds. Since the RTL module for RC5 encryption has to operate with a single round, it can incorporate four 8-bit S-box entries. These S-box entries, based on design assumptions, are to be set as follows:
  - Implement Cellular Automata for PRNG: Develop a Cellular Automata-based PRNG specifically designed to generate four 8-bit random values. These values will be used as S-box keys in the RC5 encryption process.
  - Ensure that the Cellular Automata configuration is capable of generating maximal length sequences. This is crucial for maintaining high entropy in the key stream and enhancing the cryptographic strength of the RC5 cipher.
  - Implement a combination of Rule 90 and Rule 150 in your Cellular Automata design. These rules are selected for their properties in producing complex, pseudorandom patterns, suitable for cryptographic applications.
   - Rule 90: A simple XOR of each cell with its two immediate neighbors (i.e., left and right cells).
   - Rule 150: Involves XORing each cell with its left and right neighbors and itself, resulting in a more complex pattern.
 - The CA based PRNG has to be constructed with a combination of rules R90-R90-R150-R90-R150-R90-R150-R90 with 8-bit seed of 8'hFF
 - This CA should be capable of generating (2<sup>8</sup> - 1) pseudorandom sequences.
- The encryption shall employ arithmetic and logical operations such as modulo 256 addition, left rotation, and XOR. These operations have to be executed sequentially, as each step of the algorithm depends on the output from the previous step to generate the 16-bit ciphertext.

## Working example 

### RC5 Encryption

Let us consider the following parameters:

P = 16'hFFFF ; w = 8 ; r = 1 ; S[0] = 8'h20;S[1] = 8'h10;S[2] = 8'hFF;S[3] = 8'hFF;

Solution:

A = 8'hFF; B = 8'hFF

A = (8'hFF + 8'h20) mod 256 = 1F\
B = (8'hFF + 8'h10) mod 256 = 0F

(Loop computation)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A = (((8'h1F XOR 8'h0F) <<< 8'h0F) + 8'hFF) mod 256 = (8'h08 + 8'hFF) mod 256 = 8'h07\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B = (((8'h0F XOR 8'h07) <<< 8'h07) + 8'hFF) mod 256 = (8'h04 + 8'hFF) mod 256 = 8'h03

The ciphertext output is C = 16'h0703

The `rtl` directory has four different CA implementations namely `CA_1.sv`, `CA_2.sv`, `CA_3.sv`,  and `CA_4.sv` and choose the appropriate CA design for S-box generation.
