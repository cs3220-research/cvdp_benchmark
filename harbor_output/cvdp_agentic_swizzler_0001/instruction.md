Design a `swizzler` module in SystemVerilog within a file `swizzler.sv` at the location: `rtl/swizzler.sv`. Refer to the specification provided in `docs/swizzler_specification.md` and ensure you understand its content. The specification details an advanced lane remapping mechanism (swizzling) that performs the following operations:

- **Data Unpacking:** Unpacks a flattened input data bus into an array of lanes.
- **Swizzle Mapping Unpacking:** Converts a flat, encoded swizzle map into an array, where each element indicates the source lane for a particular output lane.
- **Lane Remapping:** Rearranges the input lanes according to the swizzle map. If the `bypass` signal is asserted, the module passes the lanes through unchanged.
- **Parity Checking (Optional):** Computes the parity for each remapped lane and asserts an error signal if any lane’s parity is nonzero, based on the `ENABLE_PARITY_CHECK` parameter.
- **Output Packing:** Packs the remapped lanes back into a flat output bus.
- **Output Registering (Optional):** Registers the output data on the rising edge of the clock if `REGISTER_OUTPUT` is enabled.

Generate the complete RTL code that implements the `swizzler` module with all the features described above.
