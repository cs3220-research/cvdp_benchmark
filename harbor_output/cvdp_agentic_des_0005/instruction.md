Integrate the `des_enc` and `des_dec` modules to perform the Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) encryption. This new module must allow burst operation, where in multiple cycles in a row the valid signal can be asserted with a new data and a new key. No changes are required in any of the RTLs provided. A testbench for this module is available at `verif/tb_3des_enc.sv`.

## Specifications

- **Module Name**: `des3_enc`

- **File Name**: `des3_enc.sv` (to be added in `rtl` directory)

- **Parameters**:
    - `NBW_DATA`: Bit width of the input and output data blocks.
        - Default: 64.
        - Related interface signals: `i_data`, `o_data`.
    - `NBW_KEY`: Bit width of the key.
        - Default: 192.
        - Related interface signal: `i_key`.  
        - The 192-bit key is interpreted as three concatenated 64-bit DES keys (K1, K2, K3) used for Triple DES encryption, where `K1 = i_key[1:64]`, K2 = `i_key[65:128]`, and `K3 = i_key[129:192]`.

- **Functionality**: Implements 3DES encryption in EDE (Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt) mode using three 64-bit keys (K1, K2, K3). The input plaintext is encrypted with K1, decrypted with K2, and encrypted again with K3.

- **Latency**: The block's latency, from when `i_valid` is read until `o_valid` is asserted, is **48 cycles**, where each DES stage takes 16 cycles and the process is fully pipelined.

  |---------------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     |
  | `clk`               | Input     | 1                | Drives the sequential logic on the rising edge.                                                                          |
  | `rst_async_n`       | Input     | 1                | Active-low asynchronous reset; clears all internal registers and state.                                                  |
  | `i_valid`           | Input     | 1                | Active high. Indicates that `i_data` and `i_key` are valid and ready to be processed.                                    |
  | `i_data`            | Input     | [1:NBW_DATA]     | 64-bit plaintext input block (MSB-first).                                                                                |
  | `i_key`             | Input     | [1:NBW_KEY]      | 192-bit 3DES key, treated as three concatenated 64-bit keys: `{K1, K2, K3}`.                                             |
  | `o_valid`           | Output    | 1                | Asserted high when `o_data` contains valid encrypted data. It is asserted for as many cycles as `i_valid` is asserted.   |
  | `o_data`            | Output    | [1:NBW_DATA]     | 64-bit ciphertext output block (MSB-first).                                                                              |
