Design an `axis_to_uart_tx` module in SystemVerilog. Refer to the specification provided in `docs/axis_to_uart_tx_specs.md` and ensure you fully understand its content. The specification details the module’s parameterization for clock frequency (`CLK_FREQ`), UART bit rate (`BIT_RATE`), word size (`BIT_PER_WORD`), optional parity (0 for none, 1 for odd, 2 for even using combinational parity calculation), and configurable stop bits (`STOP_BITS_NUM`). It also describes the finite state machine (FSM) that controls the transmission process through states such as IDLE, START, DATA, PARITY, STOP1, and STOP2. The module must interface with an AXI-Stream input (using `aclk`, `aresetn`, `tdata`, `tvalid`, and `tready`) and generate a serial UART output (`TX`) with proper timing derived from a clock counter computed using the formula:

```
Cycle_per_Period = (CLK_FREQ * 1,000,000) / BIT_RATE
```

Implement the full RTL code that handles data latching from the AXI-Stream, serial output generation including start bit, data bits (transmitted LSB first), optional parity, and stop bits; correctly manage clock timing and state transitions; and ensure proper reset behavior.
